A interesting side project during winter break lol.

Basically, it is to identify if a girl you are net-dating is lying. Specifically, whether she is lying about the photo she sent you is legit herself or just some photo taken from Internet. （照骗 (Photo Spam) as in Chinese).

A lot to be worked on. But it has some basic functionalities.

To-Do:

- Replace cos hash with pHash.
- Improve scraping google images result.
